h2. BrowserCMS Reference Documentation

BrowserCMS is a general purpose, open source Web Content Management System (CMS), written in Ruby on Rails. It is designed to support three distinct groups of people:

# Non-technical web editors who want a humane system to manage their site, without needing to understand what HTML or even Rails is.
# Designers who want to create large and elegantly designed websites with no artificial constraints by the CMS.
# Developers who want to add a CMS into their Rails projects, or create CMS driven websites for their clients.

This guide is for BrowserCMS v3.0.0.
