BrowserCMS Deployment Guide
===========================

This guide covers how to setup the Apache Passenger (mod_rails) production environment for your BrowserCMS application.

== Setting Up Virtual Hosts for Page Caching ==

In order to setup BrowserCMS to due page caching, you need to create two virtual hosts for your site.  The main purpose for this is to allow page caching to work when you access a page on the main site, but then have the pages not be served from the cache when you are working in the BrowserCMS interface.

..................
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName browsercms.local
  DocumentRoot "/Users/pbarry/projects/browsercms/public"
  RailsEnv production
  RewriteEngine On
  
  # Uncomment for rewrite debugging
  #RewriteLog /Users/pbarry/projects/browsercms/log/rewrite.log
  #RewriteLogLevel 9

  #apache should serve cached pages
  RewriteRule ^/$ /cache/index.html [QSA]
  RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ /cache/$1.html [QSA]
  
  <directory "/Users/pbarry/projects/browsercms/public">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </directory>
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName cms.browsercms.local
  DocumentRoot "/Users/pbarry/projects/browsercms/public"
  RailsEnv production
  <directory "/Users/pbarry/projects/browsercms/public">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </directory>
</VirtualHost>
