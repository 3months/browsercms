== Welcome to BrowserCMS

BrowserCMS is Content Management System for the Rails web-application framework.  BrowserCMS consists of the core cms product, as well as a set of modules that can be installed in your app on a case-by-case basis as needed.  These instructions are for creating a BrowserCMS app that uses one module, the BrowserCMS News Module.  You don't have to install the BrowserCMS News Module, it is only shown here as an example of installing a module.  You could install no modules or more than one module, and the steps to do so would be roughly equivalent to what you see here.

== Getting Started

1. Install Rails 2.1 or higher:

     sudo gem install rails
       
2. Install BrowserCMS and any BrowserCMS modules you plan to use.

     sudo gem install browser_cms
     sudo gem install browser_cms_news_module

3. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application, specifying the database by using following command:

     rails my_cms -d mysql

4. Change directory into mycms

     cd my_cms

5. Remove the file at public/index.html

     rm public/index.html

6. Open config/routes.rb in a text editor.  Replace the contents of the file with the following:

     ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
       map.routes_for_browser_cms_news_module
       map.routes_for_browser_cms
     end

5. Edit config/environments.rb and add BrowserCms as a gem dependency:

     config.gem "browser_cms"
     config.gem "browser_cms_news_module"

6. Run the following command to install BrowserCMS:

     script/generate browser_cms
   
7. Run the following command to create your database:

     rake db:migrate

   Be careful to view the output of the rake command, as it will contain the username/password you should use to log into your CMS.  In development environment (which is the default, and the one you are using in this example), the username/password is always cmsadmin/cmsadmin.  In any other environment, such as production, a random password is generated for you.

8. Start the Rails web server with the following command:

     ruby script/server

9. Open http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser.  You will see the "Hello, World!" cms page.

10. Open http://localhost:3000/cms in a web browser.  Login with the username cmsadmin and password cmsadmin.  You are now logged into the CMS.

== Usage

Once you are logged into the CMS, you will see 4 tabs at the top of the page, Dashboard, Sitemap, Content Library and Administration
