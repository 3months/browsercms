= BrowserCMS

BrowserCMS provides Content Management functionality for Rails applications.  Once you have installed BrowserCMS into a Rails app, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/cms to log in.  You will be taken to the dashboard, the first section of the BrowserCMS Administration Interface.  I will refer to the BrowserCMS Administration Interface as the "CMS", because I *am* into the whole brevity thing.  The four main sections of the CMS are:

== Dashboard

The Dashboard shows you a list of tasks that are assigned to you, as well as the quick links.

== Site Map

The site map shows you the organization of all sections and pages in your site.

== Content Library

The content library is where you view/manage all of the content blocks in your CMS.

== Administration

All other tasks, especially ones left to Administrators and Developers, are in this section.

To understand the CMS, it is bet to understand a few key objects that exist in the CMS
