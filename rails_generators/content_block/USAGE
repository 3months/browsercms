Description:
    Stubs out a new content block. Pass the content block name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    This generates a model class in app/models and a migration in db/migrate.

Examples:
    `./script/generate content_block article`

        creates an Article model and migration:
            Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_create_article.rb

    `./script/generate content_block article title:string body:text published:boolean`

        creates an Article model with a string title, text body, and published flag.
