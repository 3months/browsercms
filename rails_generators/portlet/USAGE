Description:
    Stubs out a new portlet. Pass the content block name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    This generates a portlet class in app/portlets and a form in app/view/portlets.

Examples:
    `./script/generate portlet foo_portlet name:string`

        creates a Foo portlet and form
