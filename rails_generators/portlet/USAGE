Description:
    Stubs out a new portlet. Pass the portlet name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes.

    This generates a portlet class in app/portlets and a form in app/view/portlets.  
    
    The name you supply will have "portlet" added to it, much the same way controllers work.

Examples:
    `./script/generate portlet foo name:string`

        creates a Foo portlet and form
